There is much more to DraftJS than what is covered here. Apart from offering the data model and the API to make corresponding modifications; DraftJS also ships with the above Utils to help you in rendering the contents in your Editor to your desire!

You can find the rest of what you want to know at DraftJS' official home â€” [draftjs.org](https://draftjs.org).
