# Learn DraftJS

Learn DraftJS is a learning resource, inspired by [DraftJS Samples](https://draft-js-samples.now.sh)!

## Why another resource!

**DraftJS Samples** introduces DraftJS in a granular way via examples which show the editor in action; along with what's happening under the hood via console logging Draft's internal data models. However these examples are written using TypeScript.

To avoid the extra burden on the learner of having to know TypeScript beforehand; and also as an attempt to finish what DraftJS samples has started â€” a complete overview of what DraftJS offers... I've started building this!

Hope you get something out of it! :)
